<h1>Description of Data<h1>

The data used for this project was provided by Urban Ministries, a charity organization that has worked to help those in need in our community for decades.  

The data they provided was collected over multiple decades and is stored as a tsv file. It includes numerical and categorical data about their clients and the different types of assistance they received at different times.

<h1>Project 1 Overview<h1>

In this project, I will do my best to look at the data from the point of view of the people it will be most useful for: the social workers at Urban Ministries themselves. What knowledge can we glean from this data that would be most helpful for them and allow them to find ways to better help their clients?

In our first and only meeting with Urban Ministries, they mentioned one area where they are curious in learning more: which clients are they able to help make a permanent transition to self-sufficiency, and which clients continue to need help? They said they hoped to learn more about which methods were most useful and which ones were less useful.

Keeping this in mind, I will base my analysis on comparisons between clients, and specifically between clients who receive help from different durations of time. My hope is to recognize some patterns and differences between these different types of clients - perhaps see if there are any clear signs that certain types of assistance are more successful than others. In the end, my goal is to uncover information that could be useful for Urban Ministries to plan their future aid-giving.

<h1>Analysis Methods<h1>

For this project I will be relying on R, specifically packages including tidyvers, ggplot and a few others. I will attempt to wrangle the data into forms that can be used to create intuitive visualizations to help us learn more about what exactly the data has to tell us.
