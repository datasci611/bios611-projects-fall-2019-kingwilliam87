In this project, I will compare and contrast two groups: those who receive assistance for a period of time and then leave the system without returning later, and those who leave the system to return later.

I hope by this analysis to be able to see what factors may be associated with individuals improving their situations and no longer needing assistance, and which factors may be associated with only temporary reprieve from homelessness.

My aim is to provide useful evidence to support which types of assistance may be most useful, so that this can be taken into account when prioritizing resources.

As this is my first project of this sort, I expect at best to only be able to demonstrate association between different interventions and these two outcomes. Causality would be difficult to find convincing evidence for, although we will see what happens!
