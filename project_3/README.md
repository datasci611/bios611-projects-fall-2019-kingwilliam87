<h1>Description of Data</h1>

<body>
The data used for this project was provided by Urban Ministries, a charity organization that has worked to help those in need in our community for decades.  

The data they provided was collected over multiple decades and is stored over multiple files. It includes numerical and categorical data about their clients and the different types of assistance they received at different times.

<h1>Project 3 Overview</h1>

<body>
In this project, I will do my best to look at the data from the point of view of the people it will be most useful for: the social workers at Urban Ministries themselves. What knowledge can we glean from this data that would be most helpful for them and allow them to find ways to better help their clients? Given that the datafiles for this project contain much more qualitative information than our previous datafile, will look to compare different subgroups of clients based on these qualitative variables. I would like to generally understand the clients of UMD better: what is some basic information about them, what situations are they coming from, and where are they going after they leave? I also look at trends over time to see if any patterns can be recognized from the data.

<h1>Analysis Methods</h1>

<body>
For this project I will be relying on R, specifically packages including tidyverse, ggplot and a few others. I will attempt to wrangle the data into forms that can be used to create straightforward visualizations to tell us information about the clients. The analysis will be relatively simple, relying mainly on comparisons and trends that laypeople would be able to understand easily.
