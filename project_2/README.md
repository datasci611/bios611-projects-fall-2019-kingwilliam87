<h1>Description of Data</h1>

<body>
The data used for this project was provided by Urban Ministries, a charity organization that has worked to help those in need in our community for decades.  

The data they provided was collected over multiple decades and is stored as a tsv file. It includes numerical and categorical data about their clients and the different types of assistance they received at different times.
</body>

<h1>Project 2 Overview</h1>

<body>
In this project, the question I hope to help answer is, what useful information can this data tell us? This may seem like a very vague and open-ended question, but I think it is an important one. Urban Ministries have been collecting this data for decades, and I am sure they want to be able to better understand what information they can take from it.
</body>

<h1>Audience</h1>

<body>
My audience for this project will be the staff at Urban Ministries. My hope is that they can view and explore this project themselves to be able to see the information they want to see.
</body>

<h1>Analysis Methods</h1>

<body>
For this project I will be relying on R, specifically packages including tidyverse, ggplot and a few others. I will attempt to wrangle the data into forms that can be used to create straightforward visualizations to help us learn more about what exactly the data has to tell us.
</body>

<h1>Interactivity</h1>

<body>
I plan to make interactivity very simple and intuitive, so that people with very little statistical knowledge and background can use with ease.

My attempt to allow the user to "capture" an area on the first plot to populate the data for a new plot so far has eluded me. I would welcome any advice on how to do so!

I realized I forgot to include the URL:
